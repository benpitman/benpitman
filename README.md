### Hey there, welcome to my page!

I'm just a simple Bash and PHP enthusiast working as a full-stack web developer, living in Manchester, England.

I love making applications that I think others will enjoy or find useful. It all started just a few years ago, back in college, where I first learnt the joys of Bash scripting when the teacher told us to make a simple game. I ... did not make a simple game, instead I pushed myself to make it as complicated as I could; and now I have a fully functional Tetris clone written in 100% Bash as my crowning jewel.

Here's a little list of some of the projects I'm most proud of. I hope you like them.

- 🕹️ [Tetris](https://github.com/benpitman/Tetris-GNU-Bash-v4.3), a clone of the famous tetromino placing game built entirely in Bash.
- 🕹️ [Superscipt](http://github.com/benpitman/Superscript-GNU-Bash-v4), another Bash-only game. This is a clone of the game [ZType](https://zty.pe), but although it does work, it could do with some updating to better support the double-width unicode characters.
- 📦 [Kentron](https://github.com/pitmanware/kentron), a PHP utility suite for all my web-based projects to use.
- 📍 [Travel To](https://github.com/benpitman/Travel-To-Bash), a simple bash script that you source in your bashrc that allows you to save commonly used directory paths and cd to them using aliases (I use this one a lot).
- 📏 [Levenshtein](https://gist.github.com/benpitman/e1e3c158040dc78b017ce7ac6b94a9fa), a cheeky little bash function to calculate the levenshtein distance in bash without any subshells, making it nice and quick.

I also have a couple more really old Bash games from when I just started learning programming, but I wouldn't bother looking at them becuase of how poorly written the are. And a Minifier that I started and never got around to finishing; I plan to eventually though.

When I'm not coding though, I'm keeping busy with lots of other personal projects, but you can always reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pitmanware) if you feel so inclined 🙂.
